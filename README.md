# Leaderboard API â€“ Roblox Game Integration

This project provides a backend API service for managing global, weekly, and monthly leaderboards in a Roblox game. It handles player stats, batching updates from Roblox servers, and serving leaderboard data for use in-game or externally.  

**Note:** This project should not be used as the source of truth for player stats. It is intended only as an optional service for Roblox servers to get and update global statsâ€”a feature that is difficult or impossible to implement using Roblox Data Stores natively.
